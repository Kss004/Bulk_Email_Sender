with st.expander("CC vs BCC - Understanding the Difference"):
    st.markdown("""
    **CC (Carbon Copy):**
    - Recipients in the CC field will receive the email
    - All recipients (To and CC) can see who else received the email
    - Use CC when you want everyone to know who else is involved
    - Example: Sending a project update to team members

    **BCC (Blind Carbon Copy):**
    - Recipients in the BCC field will receive the email
    - Other recipients cannot see who is in the BCC field
    - Use BCC for privacy or when sending to large groups
    - Example: Sending newsletters or announcements to subscribers

    **Best Practices:**
    - Always use BCC when sending to large groups to protect privacy
    - Use CC sparingly and only when necessary
    - Be mindful of email etiquette and privacy concerns

    **Best Practices for HTML Emails:**
    
    1. **Use Inline CSS**: Most email clients strip out `<style>` tags, so use inline styles
    2. **Table-based Layout**: Use HTML tables for layout as they're more reliable across email clients
    3. **Responsive Design**: Include viewport meta tag and use responsive CSS
    4. **Image Hosting**: Host images on a public server and use absolute URLs
    5. **Fallback Fonts**: Always specify fallback fonts for better compatibility
    6. **Test Across Clients**: Test your HTML emails in different email clients
    
    **Example HTML Structure:**
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Your Email Title</title>
    </head>
    <body style="margin: 0; padding: 20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
        <h1 style="color: #333;">Hello!</h1>
        <p style="color: #666;">Your content here...</p>
    </body>
    </html>
